# Dicee
A simple dice roll app to determine a winner between 2 players. 

I made this on my own as part of Angela Yu's [The Complete 2019 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) Udemy Course.

This was my first JavaScript project in quite a while, so while it is simple, I am glad that I was able to complete it rather easily.

I also further challenged myself to condense/refactor the code as much as possible, as shown by comments of METHOD 1, METHOD 2, etc.

### Things I learned building this project
- Generating a random number between 1-6
- Basic DOM manipulation refresher
- Converting my function to an IIFE and using ES6 syntax for the final result
