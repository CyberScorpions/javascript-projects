# Keyless Card

This was built alongside Andrei Neagoie as part of his [The Complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/)

### Things I learned building this project
- Basic variable assignment
- Using Number() to return the value inputted by the user as a number because by default prompt() returns that value as a string
- Constructing a basic conditional statement using if and else if
