// OLD ANSWER
const age = prompt('What is your age?');

if (Number(age) < 18) {
  alert('Sorry, you are too yound to drive this car. Powering off');
} else if (Number(age) > 18) {
  alert('Powering On. Enjoy the ride!');
} else if (Number(age) === 18) {
  alert('Congratulations on your first year of driving. Enjoy the ride!');
}

// NEW ANSWER WITH FUNCTION
// Make the above code have a function called checkDriverAge(). Whenever you call this function, you will get prompted for age. Use Function Declaration to create this function.
function checkDriverAge() {
  const age = prompt('What is your age?');
  if (Number(age) < 18) {
    alert('Sorry, you are too yound to drive this car. Powering off');
  } else if (Number(age) > 18) {
    alert('Powering On. Enjoy the ride!');
  } else if (Number(age) === 18) {
    alert('Congratulations on your first year of driving. Enjoy the ride!');
  }
}

// Create another function that does the same thing, assign it to checkDriverAge2 variable using Function Expression.
const checkDriverAge2 = function checkDriverAge2() {
  const age = prompt('What is your age?');
  if (Number(age) < 18) {
    alert('Sorry, you are too yound to drive this car. Powering off');
  } else if (Number(age) > 18) {
    alert('Powering On. Enjoy the ride!');
  } else if (Number(age) === 18) {
    alert('Congratulations on your first year of driving. Enjoy the ride!');
  }
};

// Instead of using the prompt, now only use console.log and make the checkDriverAge() function accept an argument of age, so that if you enter:
// checkDriverAge(92);
// it returns "Powering On. Enjoy the ride!"
function checkDriverAge3(age) {
  if (Number(age) < 18) {
    return 'Sorry, you are too yound to drive this car. Powering off';
  }
  if (Number(age) > 18) {
    return 'Powering On. Enjoy the ride!';
  }
  if (Number(age) === 18) {
    return 'Congratulations on your first year of driving. Enjoy the ride!';
  }
