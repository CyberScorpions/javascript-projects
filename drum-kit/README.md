# Basic Drum Kit
A simple drum kit app. Users can either click on the buttons themselves or press the key shown on the page to play the corresponding drum sound.

I made this as part of Angela Yu's [The Complete 2019 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) Udemy Course.

### Things I learned building this project
- Higher order functions (functions that take other functions as inputs)
- How to play sounds on the page using the Audio object
- Implementing a switch statement into a project
