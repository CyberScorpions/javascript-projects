# Background Gradient Generator

This was built alongside Andrei Neagoie as part of his [The Complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/).

### Things I learned building this project

- More practice using querySelector
- More practice using functions
- Styling the body background-color based on user picked or randomly generated colors, using .textContent, and .style.background
- Using window.onload
- How to generate a random hex value for setting the background gradient colors
