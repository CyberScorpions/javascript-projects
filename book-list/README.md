# OOP Book List
A simple app where users can store some data about a book, its author, and ISBN. 

I learned to build this project as part of Brad Traversy's [Modern JavaScript From The Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/) Udemy Course.

### What I learned building this project:
- Using OOP concepts in JavaScript in a real world practical project
  - Constructors
  - Prototype methods
- Converting to ES6 Classes
- Further practice with DOM manipulation and local storage API
