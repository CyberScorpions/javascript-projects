I learned to build this project as part of Brad Traversy's [Modern JavaScript From The Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/) Udemy Course.

### What I learned building this project:
- Further practice using ES6 Classes
- First project using async/await in the course
- First time using the GitHub API
