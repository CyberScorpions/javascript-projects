# JavaScript Projects

This is a collection of vanilla JavaScript collections from various sources (my own, YouTube, Udemy). Use them as a reference, inspiration, or make em' better!

Another good idea would be to take these and re-create them with either TypeScript or React/Angular/Vue as practice if you're starting out with any of those!
